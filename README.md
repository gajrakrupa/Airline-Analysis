# ✈️ Indian Airline Operations & Route Insights

This project analyzes **Indian airline performance, delays, airport efficiency, and route connectivity** using enriched datasets and visual storytelling through **Power BI**.  
It includes complete **data cleaning, EDA, enriched CSV outputs**, and a **fully designed Power BI dashboard** for operational insights.

✨ *“Turning flight data into actionable aviation insights.”* ✨

📊 **Objectives**
- Analyze airline & airport delays  
- Study route efficiency & connectivity  
- Build month-wise KPIs, matrices & sparklines  
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Provide actionable insights for operations teams  

🧰 **Tools Used**
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** — Data Cleaning, Merging & EDA  
- **Power BI** — Dashboard & Visuals  
- **2024–2025 Airline Datasets** — Cleaned and enriched internally  

📈 **Key Insights**
- Consistent delay patterns in specific airports  
- Metro hubs handle majority of the traffic  
- Certain airlines show significantly better on-time performance  
- Domestic routes operate with higher frequency than international  
- Route connectivity influences operational delays
